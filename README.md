This is kind of a basic project.
Using javaScript it generates a tab based on the chosen scale,note, etc and displays it as a standard tab format.

It should be able to play it using a series of synths and samplers. This is using Tone.js.
Any questions feel free to email @ "adam_shaw1994@hotmail.co.uk".

Thanks!
